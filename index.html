<h1>Hi there!</h1>

<p class="p1">I am an Oakland-based journalist with interests ranging from data-driven storytelling to investigative reporting. I am passionate about making data more accessible and bringing power to underrepresented voices.</p>

<p class="p1">Most recently, I was a data reporter at the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/author/adriana-rezal">San Francisco Chronicle</a>. There, I regularly produced data-driven news articles and graphics about topics like demographics and city services. Here's some of the work I did there:<p class="p1">

<div class="myclips">
<h3><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/projects/2022/fixing-san-francisco-problems/">SFNext Index: Key facts about San Francisco</a></h3>
<p class="p1">A dashboard-style collection of data facts and figures for topics including homelessness, housing and crime in San Francisco. I designed the dashboard’s layout, contributed original reporting and produced all Datawrapper graphics seen here.<p class="p1">
</div>
<br>
<div class="myclips">
<h3><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/poop-san-francisco-17390755.php">Poop complaints have swelled in all San Francisco neighborhoods — except this one</a></h3>
<p class="p1">I downloaded millions of rows of data from the city’s 311 requests database, implemented cleaning and recoding strategies using R, and produced three Datawrapper visualizations to enhance readers' understanding of the data, including a map of feces-related calls by neighborhood.<p class="p1">
</div>
<br>
<div class="myclips">
<h3><a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/immigration-population-18081467.php">This demographic group is a big driver in S.F.’s population decline</a></h3>
<p class="p1">I gathered and cleaned data from microdata datasets including IPUMS and the American Community Survey to create Datawrapper graphics highlighting demographic changes in San Francisco.<p class="p1">
</div>
<br>
<p class="p1">Before moving to the Bay Area, I was a data fellow with <a href="https://www.usnews.com/topics/author/adriana-rezal">U.S. News and World Report</a>. I also spent a summer in Chicago as a reporting intern covering immigration in the Midwest for <a href="https://borderlessmag.org/author/adriana-rezal">Borderless Magazine</a>.<p class="p1">

<div class="myclips">
<h3><a href="https://borderlessmag.org/2021/07/14/as-covid-19-spread-through-midwest-detention-centers-ice-struggled-to-provide-accurate-data/">As COVID-19 Spread Through Midwest Detention Centers, ICE Struggled To Provide Accurate Data</a></h3>
<p class="p1">I utilized Excel to clean a large dataset, built interactive Flourish visualizations and communicated with government sources. This article revealed flaws in how the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement presents publicly available data.<p class="p1">
</div>
<br>
<div class="myclips">
<h3><a href="https://borderlessmag.org/2021/06/30/as-immigration-laws-change-one-mchenry-man-slips-through-the-cracks/">As Immigration Laws Change, One McHenry Man Slips Through The Cracks</a></h3>
<p class="p1">A long-form feature story examining Chicago's changing immigration laws, and the families they failed to help.<p class="p1">
</div>

<p class="p1">I graduated from the University of Texas with a degree in International Relations and Global Studies with a minor in Journalism. In addition to writing for the school’s official newspaper, <a href="https://thedailytexan.com/staff_name/adriana-rezal">The Daily Texan</a>, I also contributed fashion and lifestyle articles to other student-run publications including <a href="https://issuu.com/sparkmagazinetx/docs/issue_10-ilovepdf-compressed__1_">SPARK Magazine</a> and <a href="https://orangemagazine.net/orangeblog/tag/Adriana+Rezal">ORANGE</a>.<p class="p1">

<p class="p1">
I grew up in the Houston area but currently call the East Bay home. In my spare time, I like to shoot film, host craft nights and play D&D.
